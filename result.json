He is lecture heavy. He uploads his notes but without context from the discussion that day, it will leave you confused. Participation recommended. Attendence recommended for pop quizzes."

It was an introductory class, with 95% of us never having taken a gender course, and he would constantly criticize us for not already knowing things we were there to learn. I skipped almost all classes, but did the reading and passed."

Only big negative is that there is a LOT of reading. My number one tip is don't be afraid to be critical in ur reviews!"

Bought the book, but had no use for it because his lectures provided all of the knowledge needed for the quizzes. Go to class every day, quizzes are worth 100 points and can really mess up your grade if you miss one. Funny guy, good class."

The class is more of a discussion lecture class where anyone can say their opinions and he wants students to join in on the topics he talks about. He does give surprise quizzes so always be ready for it and always have scantrons on you. Highly recommend him for the requirement!"

Take notes on definitions-- (book isn't helpful cause it doesn't seem like he even read it) chapter outlines on PowerPoint often mismatched topics from previous chapters."

All of the questions he asks in each exam are pretty straightforward; so as long as you show up to class you're sure to pass. My only issue was his attitude. He can be really rude at times, and he yells at the class as if we were children."

You never know when the quizzes are going to be. There are only 2 tests and they are fairly easy if you take good notes and study them well.  He makes you feel stupid when you email him questions"

No powerpoints or anything, just him talking about whatever the subject is that day. Very easy pop quizzes every 2 weeks or so. 1 midterm and 1 final. The book isn't very useful though because he goes over everything in class."
